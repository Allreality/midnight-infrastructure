🚀  Major Compact Milestone and Release

Hey builders @here, we are excited to announce that the Compact language will be open sourced as a project of the Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT). With the stewardship of LFDT, we will tap into the power of the open-source community to accelerate the development of privacy-preserving technologies. As part of this milestone, the Compact language name will be changed and now formally known as Minokawa, homage to the dragon-like bird in Phillipine mythology that eclipses the sun. 🐉

This milestone comes with a fresh release of the language (Compact Language 0.17 → Minokawa Language 0.18) along with shipping the Compact Compiler 0.26.0. Over time, we will work towards changing the naming conventions of all Compact related tools to Minokawa to avoid any confusion. Thank you for bearing with us!
