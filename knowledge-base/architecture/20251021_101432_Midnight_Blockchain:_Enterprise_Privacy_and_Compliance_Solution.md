```typescript
// Confidential Transaction Example
function createPrivateTransaction(
  sender: Identity, 
  recipient: Identity, 
  amount: number
): ConfidentialTransaction {
  const encryptedTransaction = zeroKnowledgeProof.encrypt({
    sender: sender.publicKey,
    recipient: recipient.publicKey,
    amount: amount
  });

  return {
    proof: encryptedTransaction,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    status: 'VERIFIED'
  };
}
```

## 5. Risk and Limitation Assessment

### Potential Challenges
- Initial implementation complexity
- Technical team learning curve
- Performance overhead
