  • Uses zk-SNARKS (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
  • Enables cryptographic proof of data validity without exposing raw data

- Privacy Preservation Characteristics
  • Selective data disclosure
  • Cryptographic data integrity
  • Compliance with regulatory frameworks
  • Minimal information leakage

3. Technical Specifications:
- Proof Generation Algorithm
  • Computational complexity: O(log n)
  • Proof size: Approximately 256-512 bytes
  • Verification time: Near-instantaneous (<100ms)

- Cryptographic Infrastructure
  • Base protocol: Built on Cardano blockchain
  • Consensus mechanism: Proof-of-Stake variant
  • Encryption standard: Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms

4. Healthcare Use Cases:
