# Cardano

Research Findings: Cardano Blockchain Infrastructure

1. Overview
- Blockchain platform founded by Charles Hoskinson in 2015
- Developed by IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong)
- Utilizes peer-reviewed academic research methodology
- Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Ouroboros
- Native cryptocurrency: ADA

2. Technical Architecture
- Multi-layer blockchain design:
  a) Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)
  b) Cardano Computation Layer (CCL)
- Supports smart contracts and decentralized applications
- Enables complex programmable transactions
- Enhanced scalability and energy efficiency compared to proof-of-work systems

3. Key Technical Specifications
- Consensus Mechanism: Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake
- Programming Languages: Haskell (backend), Plutus (smart contracts)
- Transaction Speed: ~250 transactions per second
- Low energy consumption
- Advanced cryptographic protocols
- On-chain governance model

4. Unique Features
- Formal verification of protocol
- Sustainability through treasury system
- Interoperability with other blockchains
- Focus on academic research and peer-reviewed development

5. Use Cases
- Financial services
- Identity management
- Supply chain tracking
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Government and enterprise solutions
- Emerging markets infrastructure

6. Potential Limitations
- Relatively complex development environment
- Slower adoption compared to Ethereum
- Ongoing scalability challenges
- Dependency on research-driven approach

7. Comparative Advantages
- Energy efficiency
- Scientific methodology
- Strong security model
- Robust governance structure

8. References
- Official Cardano Documentation
- IOHK Research Papers
- Cardano Foundation publications
- Academic blockchain research journals

Recommended Further Investigation:
- Ouroboros consensus mechanism
- Plutus smart contract platform
- Project Catalyst governance model
