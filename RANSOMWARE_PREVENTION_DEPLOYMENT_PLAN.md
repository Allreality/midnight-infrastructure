## Legal Protection (CRITICAL)

### Contracts Needed
1. **Master Services Agreement (MSA)**
   - Scope of work
   - Payment terms
   - Liability limitations
   - IP protection

2. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
   - Mutual NDA with all prospects
   - Protect proprietary algorithms
   - 5-year term minimum

3. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**
   - 99.99% uptime guarantee
   - Response time commitments
   - Support availability
   - Penalty clauses

4. **Intellectual Property Agreement**
   - You retain all IP
   - Client receives usage license only

## Go-To-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Stealth (Current)
- Build reference implementations
- Document case studies
- Prepare all sales materials
- Legal framework in place

### Phase 2: Selective Disclosure (When Ready)
**Target Sectors:**
1. **Healthcare** - HIPAA + NIST compliance required
   - Average ransomware cost: $9.2M per incident
   - 60% experience attacks annually
   
2. **Financial Services** - Regulatory requirements
   - SEC requires incident disclosure
   - Average attack cost: $5.9M

3. **Government Contractors** - NIST 800-171 mandatory
   - DoD contracts require compliance
   - Losing contract > $500K

4. **Critical Infrastructure** - Energy, utilities
   - National security implications
   - Regulatory penalties for breaches

### Phase 3: Scaling
- Partner with MSPs (managed service providers)
- Reseller agreements
- Training program for implementation partners
- Franchise model for deployment teams
