FIGURE 5 - Actual Deployed System Architecture

[Describe this figure:]

Components (Left to Right, Top to Bottom):
1. Client Browser (Windows) → connects to WSL IP 172.24.187.115:5002
2. Flask API Server (Port 5002) with 5 REST endpoints
3. Knowledge Base Layer (132 documents, 26 categories)
4. AI Agent System (4 agents: analyzer, researcher, orchestrator, connector)
5. Midnight Blockchain Integration (planned - attestation, ZK proofs, x402)

Data Flow:
- Browser → API Server → Knowledge Base → AI Agents → Blockchain
- Continuous monitoring loop: Agents → Knowledge Base → Gap Analysis → Remediation

Key Metrics Shown:
- 241.37 hours development time
- 132 documents indexed
- 27 NIST documents
- 5/14 control families covered
- 9/14 gaps identified

This figure demonstrates reduction to practice with operational metrics.
