Questions to Answer First

Which compliance framework should we tackle FIRST?

HIPAA (healthcare) - Largest market
SOX (financial) - Most complex
GDPR (general) - Broadest applicability


What's the MVP?

Just documentation generation?
Include compliance checking?
Real-time regulatory monitoring?


Target Audience Priority?

Healthcare developers?
Financial institutions?
Enterprise architects?
All of the above?



Your Decision Needed
Which path forward?
Path A: Healthcare First (Recommended)

Tackle HIPAA immediately
Biggest impact potential
Clear use cases
18-month timeline

Path B: Multi-Framework

Cover multiple regulations
Broader appeal
Longer timeline
Risk of spreading thin

Path C: Research Only

Focus on agent intelligence
Build comprehensive system
Delay specific frameworks
Slower to market value
My Recommendation: Path A (Healthcare First)
Why?

Clear, urgent need
Midnight's ZK-proofs perfect fit
Measurable impact
Can expand from there
