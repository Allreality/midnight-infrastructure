One‑Page Appendix — Midnight Infrastructure (PDF‑ready)
Project name: Midnight Infrastructure
Founder: Akil Hashim | contact: akil@midnight-compliance.com | www.midnight-compliance.com
Purpose
Deliver an open-source, privacy‑first stack that makes tokenized onboarding reproducible and audit-ready for community and civic projects. Funded work will produce deterministic CI artifacts, a Shielded‑tuned demo, counsel‑vetted compliance templates, and two pilot deployments.
Scope (6–9 months)
- Core deliverable: Public GitHub repo with v1 code, deterministic Docker images, and CI that reproduces build artifacts.
- Demo: One-click deploy demo site showing a privacy-first onboarding flow configurable to call ZK attestation endpoints.
- Simulation suite: Runnable examples in Python, Node, and Docker with automated reproducibility tests.
- Compliance pack: Counsel memo + template term sheet, entity checklist, and pilot-specific guardrails.
- Pilots: Two community/civic pilot deployments with short reports and playbook.
Milestones & Acceptance Criteria
- Kickoff & repo scaffold (30%) — repo scaffold; technical roadmap; pilot LOIs; draft SOW for counsel.
- Core dev & deterministic CI (40%) — deployed demo; CI produces deterministic artifacts; at least one runnable simulation across runtimes.
- Pilots, counsel memo & final report (30%) — two pilots completed with reports; legal memo delivered; public impact report and packaged deliverables.
Budget (Shielded/Midnight Foundation tuning) — Total ask: $60,000
- Core engineering & deterministic CI: $28,000
- Demo & Shielded integration: $7,000
- Legal & compliance review: $9,000
- Pilot stipends & outreach: $6,000
- Documentation & impact reporting: $3,000
- Contingency (10%): $6,000
Key outcomes for funders
- Reproducible developer artifacts that reduce onboarding time and audit friction.
- Shielded‑compatible demo and integration notes for ZK proof anchoring.
- Counsel‑vetted compliance templates enabling safer, faster civic pilots.
- Open-license deliverables and a public playbook for community stewards.
Quick ask / CTA
Request: $60,000 in three tranches tied to milestones above. I can present a 10–15 minute walkthrough and share the repo scaffold and draft MOU on request.

Short Pilot MOU — Midnight Infrastructure & Community Partner
This MOU outlines the pilot engagement between Midnight Infrastructure (Developer) and the Community Partner (Partner). It is non-binding except for the confidentiality clause and the pilot stipend terms where specified. A formal pilot agreement will follow upon mutual approval.
Parties
- Developer: Midnight Infrastructure, represented by Akil Hashim.
- Partner: [Partner organization name], represented by [Name, Title].
Purpose
Deploy and validate a privacy-first onboarding flow and reproducible simulation in a community/civic context to evaluate deployability, compliance guardrails, and developer effort savings.
Pilot scope (4–8 weeks)
- Deploy the Midnight demo to Partner’s staging environment or a Partner-provided sandbox.
- Run the provided simulation suite for Partner’s use case (up to 3 configured scenarios).
- Collect deployment metrics: time-to-deploy, errors per 1,000 simulated transactions, and developer-hours required.
- Deliver a short pilot report summarizing findings, recommended adjustments, and compliance observations.
Deliverables (Developer)
- Demo deployment script and one-click deploy recipe.
- Pre-configured simulation scenarios (Python, Node, Docker).
- 1-hour orientation session for Partner devs and written quickstart guide.
- Final pilot report (1–3 pages) with action items.
Partner responsibilities
- Provide access to staging or sandbox environment and a technical point of contact (POC).
- Allocate up to 8 developer-hours for integration and testing.
- Share pilot metrics and qualitative feedback within 2 weeks after pilot end.
Stipend and timing
- Pilot stipend: $3,000 payable to Partner on completion of pilot acceptance (two pilots total across the project).
- Pilot window: mutually scheduled within project months 4–7.
- Acceptance: Partner confirms deployment reproducibility and receipt of final report within 7 days.
Confidentiality
- Both parties agree to keep non-public technical and business information confidential for 12 months. Public deliverables (repo, demo, playbook) are released under an open-source license as agreed.
IP and licensing
- Developer retains ownership of core codebase and publishes pilot-contributed non-sensitive improvements under a permissive open-source license (MIT or Apache 2.0).
- Partner retains ownership of any Partner-specific data or proprietary integration code.
Limitation of liability & safety
- Developer will not perform legal or compliance advice beyond delivering the counsel‑vetted compliance pack. Partner is responsible for any decisions to issue tokens or public claims. Developer and Partner agree to limit liability to direct damages capped at the total stipend amount.
Next steps & sign‑offs
- Developer provides repo scaffold, quickstart, and draft deployment checklist.
- Partner confirms POC, pilot start date, and signs this MOU.
- Upon mutual sign-off, Developer schedules orientation and pilot kickoff.
