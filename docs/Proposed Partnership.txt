Proposed Partnership

Subject: Proposed Partnership — Legal Counsel for Midnight Infrastructure (revenue-share offer)
Dear [Name],
Thank you for offering to review submissions. I’m building Midnight Infrastructure, a modular, privacy-first framework for reproducible onboarding, tokenized compliance flows, and audit-grade traceability. I need a blockchain/crypto lawyer to handle entity formation, tokenomics and compliance review, contracts, and ongoing counsel.
I have limited cash but can offer a revenue-share arrangement in lieu of fees. Key proposal highlights:
• 	Scope: entity formation, token & compliance review, token/terms drafting, standard customer/vendor agreements, and periodic counsel.
• 	Compensation: X% of net profits (proposal: [insert %]) from Midnight Infrastructure, paid quarterly, with audited accounting and full reporting rights.
• 	Term: [proposed term, e.g., 3 years with automatic renewal or step-down to Y% thereafter] or alternative: in perpetuity with a capped total payout or a buyout option.
• 	Governance: buyout option and dispute resolution by arbitration in [state/country].
• 	Next steps: if this structure interests you, I’d like to schedule a short call to share projections, a draft statement of work, and a proposed term sheet.
I can provide a concise roadmap, projected revenue model, and a draft term sheet for review. I’m open to structuring the deal to reduce risk for you (vesting, cap, buyout). Thank you for considering this partnership.
Sincerely,
Akil Hashim
Founder, Midnight Infrastructure
