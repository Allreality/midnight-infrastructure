## After LinkedIn Connection
Subject: Following up - Security Assessment

Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! I saw you [engaged with my post / work in healthcare / etc].

Given your role, you might be interested in a complimentary security assessment. Our AI agents analyze your NIST 800-171 posture and identify gaps—no cost, no obligation.

Would a brief call make sense to discuss?

Best,
Akil
