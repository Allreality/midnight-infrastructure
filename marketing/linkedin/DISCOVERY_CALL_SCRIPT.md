# Discovery Call Script - Total Reality Global
**Goal:** Qualify prospect, understand needs, schedule demo or assessment

---

## OPENING (2 minutes)

"Thanks for taking the time to connect [Name]. I saw you [engaged with my LinkedIn post / reached out about NIST compliance / mentioned ransomware concerns].

Before I dive into the solution, I'd love to understand your specific situation—that way I can make sure we're focusing on what's most relevant to you.

Does that sound good?"

---

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (15-20 minutes)

**Situation Assessment:**
1. "What's currently driving your interest in [ransomware prevention / NIST compliance]?"
2. "Walk me through what happened that made this a priority now."
3. "What does your current security architecture look like?"

**Pain Points:**
4. "What's your biggest concern—ransomware attacks, compliance requirements, or both?"
5. "Have you had any security incidents in the past year?"
6. "What's keeping you up at night about your current setup?"

**Requirements:**
7. "Do you need to meet NIST 800-171? By when?"
8. "Are you working with any specific compliance mandates?" (NIH, DoD, etc.)
9. "What would a successful outcome look like for you?"

**Decision Process:**
10. "Who else is involved in this decision besides you?"
11. "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
12. "What budget range are you working with?" (If asked: "Enterprise solutions start at $500K")

**Competitive:**
13. "Have you looked at other solutions?"
14. "What did you like or not like about what you've seen?"

## SOLUTION OVERVIEW (10 minutes)

"Based on what you've shared, here's how our approach differs...

**Your Challenge:** [Repeat their specific pain point]

**Our Solution:**
- Hardware-level isolation (ransomware can't spread even with admin access)
- Blockchain audit trails (immutable evidence for compliance)
- AI agents (continuous automated monitoring)
- Complete NIST coverage (14/14 control families)

**Why This Matters to You:** [Connect to their specific situation]

**The Result:** [Paint the after picture—protected, compliant, confident]

Questions on any of that?"

## NEXT STEPS (5 minutes)

**Option A - High Interest:**
"It sounds like this could be a strong fit. I'd like to propose two next steps:

1. Our AI agents can run a complimentary gap analysis of your current NIST posture—takes about 48 hours, gives you a clear baseline.

2. Following that, we can schedule a technical deep-dive with your team to walk through the architecture and discuss implementation.

Does that work for you?"

**Option B - Medium Interest:**
"I don't want to push you into anything premature. How about I send you:
- Our technical whitepaper
- A case study framework showing ROI
- Our NIST compliance documentation

Then we can reconnect in [timeframe they mentioned] to see if you want to explore further?"

**Option C - Needs Time:**
"I understand you need to [consult with team / review budget / etc]. 

Here's what I'll do: I'll send you a summary of what we discussed plus some resources. 

Can we schedule a 15-minute follow-up in [one week / two weeks] to see where you're at?"

---

## CLOSING

"Really appreciate your time [Name]. I'll send you a recap email today with [agreed deliverables].

Looking forward to [next concrete action].

Any other questions before we wrap up?"

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**"That sounds expensive."**
→ "I appreciate that $500K is a significant investment. Here's the math: average ransomware cost is $6.35M, and 60% of organizations are hit annually. So the expected annual cost of NOT having this protection is $3.8M. Even at $500K plus $100K/year support, you're ahead by year 2. Would it help to see a detailed ROI analysis for your specific environment?"

**"We already have [competitor solution]."**
→ "That's great that you're taking security seriously. The question is—are you protected at the hardware level, or is [competitor] monitoring in software? Because if an attacker gains privilege escalation, software controls can be bypassed. Our hardware approach physically prevents that. Would you be open to a comparison?"

**"We need to think about it."**
→ "Absolutely understandable. What specifically do you need to think through? Is it budget, technical fit, timeline, or something else? I ask because if there's something I can help clarify, I'd rather address it now than leave you with uncertainty."

**"Can we do a pilot?"**
→ "We don't typically do pilots because of the hardware procurement required, but what we CAN do is a complimentary gap analysis that shows you exactly where you stand today. That's zero risk, zero cost, and gives you concrete data to make your decision. Would that work?"

**"We're not ready yet."**
→ "Fair enough. When do you think you'll be ready? And what needs to happen between now and then? I ask because the NIH mandate hits January 25th—if compliance is driving this, waiting could put you in a challenging position. But I don't want to pressure you into the wrong timing either."
