🛡️ Patent Pending: Hardware-Enforced Ransomware Prevention

I'm excited to share that Total Reality Global has filed a provisional patent (App No. 63/917,456) for a breakthrough in cybersecurity: hardware-enforced compliance architecture that prevents ransomware attacks at the processor level.

The Challenge:
Healthcare organizations face $9.2M average ransomware costs. 60% are attacked annually. Traditional software-only defenses fail when attackers gain privilege escalation.

Our Solution:
We've developed a system that combines:
- AMD EPYC secure enclaves (hardware memory encryption)
- Blockchain immutable audit trails
- AI-powered compliance monitoring
- Complete NIST 800-171 coverage (14/14 control families)

How It Works:
Even if ransomware infiltrates your network, it can't access encrypted memory, can't spread between hardware-isolated enclaves, and can't delete audit logs. The attack is contained, recorded, and neutralized—automatically.

Why This Matters:
The NIH mandate (effective January 25, 2025) requires NIST 800-171 compliance for research institutions. We're helping organizations meet this requirement while simultaneously protecting against ransomware.

After 241 hours of development and 154 compliance documents, we're ready to help organizations transform their security posture from reactive to proactive.
