Behind the Patent: 14/14 NIST Control Family Coverage

Following up on my patent announcement earlier this week—I wanted to share what makes this solution unique beyond the hardware component.

Complete Compliance Coverage:
Our system addresses all 14 NIST SP 800-171 control families:
✅ Access Control (47 documents)
✅ Audit & Accountability
✅ System & Communications Protection
✅ System & Information Integrity
... and 10 more

Why This Matters:
Most security vendors cover 8-10 control families. We cover all 14.

Most vendors use software-only controls. We enforce at the hardware level.

Most vendors provide reports. We provide cryptographic proof via blockchain.

The Technical Architecture:
1️⃣ AMD SEV-SNP secure enclaves (hardware isolation)
2️⃣ Midnight blockchain (immutable attestation)
3️⃣ AI agents (continuous compliance monitoring)
4️⃣ Zero-knowledge proofs (privacy-preserving verification)

For Regulated Industries:
If you need to demonstrate NIST 800-171 compliance for NIH grants, DoD contracts, or federal partnerships—this architecture provides verifiable evidence, not just documentation.

Built with 154 compliance documents and AI-powered automation.

Thoughts on hardware-enforced security vs. software-only approaches?
